# Simple-Computational-Fluid-Dynamics
In this repository, i create a simple computational fluid dynamics (CFD) that built from pure mathematical scratch and physics basic principle without depending on any other CFD packages. I create the CPU only computation and also with GPU. This is a simple 2D CFD solver. For more colaboration and information contact me at m.arief.m@outlook.com
