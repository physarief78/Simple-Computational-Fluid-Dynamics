# Simple-Computational-Fluid-Dynamics
In this repository, i create a simple computational fluid dynamics (CFD) that built from pure mathematical scratch and physics basic principle without depending on any other CFD packages. I create the CPU only computation and also with GPU. This is a simple 2D CFD solver. 

The code was built mainly using The Julia Programming Language with version of 1.12.2. The code use the packages and its version of:

  [052768ef] CUDA v5.9.5
  [5ae59095] Colors v0.13.1
  [e9467ef8] GLMakie v0.13.7
  [ee78f7c6] Makie v0.24.7
  [510215fc] Observables v0.5.5
  [90137ffa] StaticArrays v1.9.15
  [37e2e46d] LinearAlgebra v1.12.0
  [9a3f8284] Random v1.11.0
